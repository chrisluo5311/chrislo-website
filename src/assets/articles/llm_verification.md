# Thesis review on "Toward Verifiable Misinformation Detection: A Multi-Tool LLM Agent Framework"

From: https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03092

## Overview
- **Goal**: Build a robust system to detect and verify misinformation using a multi-tool collaborative framework centered on LLM agents.
- **Key Idea**: Overcome the context window limit of LLMs by maintaining a **persistent working memory** and coordinating multiple specialized tools.

---

## Motivation
- LLMs struggle with:
  - Limited context windows.
  - Susceptibility to paraphrased or rewritten misinformation (e.g., whitewashing).
  - Hallucinations when lacking external verification.
- Need: A system that **cross-checks evidence** and **uses external tools** to ensure accuracy.

## Methodology

### Agent Workflow (Three-Stage Process)

| Stage | Description | Role of LLM |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **1. Planning & Analysis** | Identifies claim type (factual, numerical, source-based, etc.) and chooses strategy. | Acts as planner and controller. |
| **2. Multi-Tool Execution & Evidence Gathering** | Calls external tools to collect and verify evidence. Results stored in working memory. | Directs tool usage and interprets results. |
| **3. Evidence Synthesis & Conclusion Generation** | Retrieves relevant evidence from memory and writes a final verification report. | Integrates evidence, generates reasoning trace and conclusion. |

### Tools Used

| Tool | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Web Search Tool** | Retrieves live information from the internet. |
| **Source Credibility Assessment Tool** | Rates sources based on a predefined reliability dataset. |
| **Numerical Claim Verification Tool** | Uses Python interpreter for arithmetic/statistical checks. |
| **Persistent Working Memory** | Logs intermediate results, evidence, and metadata across steps. |

### Key Technique
- **Prompting + Orchestration (ReAct-style)**  
  - LLM = orchestrator (decides actions).  
  - Tools = executors (perform specialized subtasks).  
  - Emphasis on transparency, modularity, and robustness.

## Robustness Testing

### Scenarios Tested
1. **Normal** – direct claims.  
2. **Paraphrasing** – reworded claims, same meaning.  
3. **LLM Whitewashing** – maliciously rewritten to hide negative info.

### Results (Accuracy)
- **Our Method**:  
  - Normal: 90%  
  - Paraphrasing: 85%  
  - Whitewashing: 80%  
- **GPT-4o Baseline**:  
  - Normal: 85%  
  - Paraphrasing: 75%  
  - Whitewashing: 65%

**Conclusion**: Framework is significantly more robust to rewriting attacks, especially “whitewashing”.

## Contributions
- Introduces a **multi-tool LLM agent framework** for misinformation verification.  
- Shows that persistent memory + tool orchestration improves robustness.  
- Empirically demonstrates resilience against paraphrasing and malicious rewriting.

## Strengths & Limitations

### Strengths
- Transparent workflow with reasoning trace.  
- Modular design → easy to add new tools.  
- Strong robustness against adversarial information rewriting.

### Limitations
- Heavy reliance on LLM prompting.  
- Credibility assessment depends on quality of external dataset.  
- System may be slow due to multi-step orchestration.  
- Generalization to unseen domains remains uncertain.

---

## Key Takeaways
- **Whitewashing** = malicious rewriting to hide/soften critical info.  
- **Persistent Memory** is essential for multi-step verification.  
- Multi-tool collaboration reduces hallucination & bias.  
- Future direction: integrate fairness-aware retrieval and more automated tool selection.
